Key Improvements Made re: 
1. Deutanopia-Friendly Colors

Blue instead of green for correct positions
Magenta instead of yellow for wrong positions
Gray for absent letters
These colors are clearly distinguishable for people with red-green colorblindness

2. High Contrast Mode

White text on colored backgrounds for maximum visibility
User can choose between standard and high-contrast at startup

3. Symbol Support

█ (solid block) for correct position
○ (circle) for wrong position
· (dot) for absent letters
Provides redundant encoding beyond just color

4. Accessibility Configuration
