Wordle Combinations Finder
A Python script to find possible 5-letter English words that match Wordle puzzle constraints based on user guesses and feedback. The script emphasizes letter placement, filtering words according to correct letters in correct positions (green), correct letters in wrong positions (yellow), and incorrect letters (red).
Features

Input Validation: Ensures guesses are 5-letter words and feedback uses 'G' (green), 'Y' (yellow), or 'R' (red) for each position.
Letter Placement Logic: Accurately handles Wordle rules, including:
Green: Letter must be in the specified position.
Yellow: Letter must be in the word but not in the specified position.
Red: Letter must not be in the word, unless required by green/yellow elsewhere.


Robust Error Handling: Manages invalid inputs and unexpected end-of-file (EOF) conditions gracefully.
Extensible Word List: Uses a sample list of 5-letter words, which can be replaced with a comprehensive dictionary.
User-Friendly Interface: Interactive command-line prompts guide users to enter guesses and feedback.

Prerequisites

Python 3.6+: The script uses standard Python libraries (re, collections).
A text editor or IDE to modify the word list or script (optional).
A comprehensive list of 5-letter English words (optional, for better coverage).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wordle-combinations-finder.git
cd wordle-combinations-finder


Ensure Python is Installed:Verify Python 3.6 or higher is installed:
python --version

If not installed, download it from python.org.

(Optional) Update Word List:The script includes a sample list of 5-letter words in wordle_combinations.py. To improve accuracy, replace the WORD_LIST variable with a comprehensive list:

Source a word list (e.g., from a dictionary file or Wordle’s official word list).
Update the WORD_LIST variable in the script:WORD_LIST = ["word1", "word2", "word3", ...]





Usage

Run the Script:
python wordle_combinations.py


Enter Guesses and Feedback:

Guess: Enter a 5-letter word (e.g., crane).
Feedback: Enter a 5-character string using:
G for green (correct letter, correct position).
Y for yellow (correct letter, wrong position).
R for red (letter not in the word).


Example:Guess (or 'done' to finish): crane
Feedback (G/Y/R for each position): GYRRR


Type done to finish entering guesses and see results.


View Results:The script outputs a sorted list of possible words that match all constraints and the total count of possible words.


Example
Suppose you’re solving a Wordle puzzle and make two guesses:
Wordle Combinations Finder
Enter guesses and feedback (G=green, Y=yellow, R=red). Type 'done' to finish.
Example: Guess: 'crane', Feedback: 'GYRRR'

Guess (or 'done' to finish): crane
Feedback (G/Y/R for each position): GYRRR
Guess (or 'done' to finish): audio
Feedback (G/Y/R for each position): RRGYR
Guess (or 'done' to finish): done

Output (based on the sample word list):
Possible Wordle answers:
eagle
mango
Total possible words: 2

This indicates eagle and mango are the only words in the sample list that satisfy:

crane (C in position 1, not elsewhere; other letters absent unless required).
audio (D in position 3; I in the word but not position 4; O in position 5).

Limitations

Sample Word List: The default WORD_LIST is small for demonstration. Replace it with a full 5-letter word list for real Wordle puzzles.
Interactive Input: Designed for command-line interaction. For non-interactive use, modify the script to accept input via files or arguments.
Wordle Rules: Assumes standard Wordle feedback rules. Variations (e.g., hard mode) may require adjustments.
